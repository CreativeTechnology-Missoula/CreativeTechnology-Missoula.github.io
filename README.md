# Creative Technology in Missoula

[Schedule](schedule.md)

[Meet-up Notes](meet-notes.md)


## What is this?
We are a meetup group for artists and technologists in Missoula, MT (and nearby). We meet once a month, and there we all engage in conversations about the intersection of art and technology, share work that we are inspired by or are currently engaged with, and meet others in the community doing similar things.

## Who is it for?
- For the “art-tech” curious!
- For the creative technologist.
- For the scientist.

Art and technology is obviously a vast topic, and we want to see people of all backgrounds coming to share. Film, dance, theatre, music, painting, engineering, design, anyone.

## Format

We meet once a month, where we all share what we are currently working on, or things that we have seen or heard about that interest us. For each month, a different member will volunteer to lead a discussion about a particular topic. We want this to be an opportunity for us to share our expertise with others would might never know of that field or practice.

Those who would like to share their work for critique would also be welcome.
