# Creative Technology in Missoula 
It’s pretty narrow; as in “Art & Tech”.
BUT, It’s perfectly broad and narrow enough.

### Who is it for?
- For the “art-tech” curious!
- For the creative technologist.
- For the scientist.
- 

### Things we should explore
- A Virtual Presence 
	- Meetup?
	- FB?
	- GitHub Sites

### What is this meeting like?
- Do we rotate through talks and demo’s every session?
- A “self-help” type group
	- Verbalizing ideas to receive feedback
	- Being able to talk through art/tech ideas
		- practicing “the talk”
	- Teaching elements? 

- **Perhaps scheduled**
	- 1st half is a specific topic, pre-chosen
	- 2nd half more open floor



### What are we?
- A place in Missoula, where anyone working on any creative coding, digital art, interactive stuff. 
- Creating a scene
- **A mini-critique**
- Potential “Collective Show” from this group within the town.
